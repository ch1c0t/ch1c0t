I believe that -- if we understand human nature deep enough and create necessary tools -- we will be able to heal any disease. That it will be possible for older people to become as healthy as they were when they were young.

Also, I like learning, figuring out how things work, and helping other people learn. You are welcome to contact me: chertoly@gmail.com.
